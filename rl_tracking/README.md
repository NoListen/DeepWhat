# Goal
- A RL algorithm to detect one object and track the object along its moving direction.
- Achieve multiple tracking using RNN

# Progress
- Implement a simple pygame enviroment where the bounding box's goal is to cover the target rectangle.
- implement [reinforce](https://github.com/NoListen/RL-forest/tree/master/RL_forest/reinforce_plant) algorithm. See the [result](https://youtu.be/pqewVnAjMMw) after 3000 episodes.
